Fast paced asteroids game. Easy to play but totally unforgiving.

Fy first complete game. It got me acquainted with Unity and the app stores.

Touch the left half of the screen to move left, the right half moves it right. Try to complete the goals on each mission to move on to the next one.

Features:
- Randomly generated levels.
- Goals system
- Logaritmic difficulty
- End of episodes cutscenes

Use "a" and "d" to steer the ship. Left mouse click to navigate through the menus.<br>
