Fast paced asteroids game. Easy to play but totally unforgiving.

My first from begging to end game. It got me acquainted with the app stores.
It features randomly generated levels, logarithmic difficulty, goals and cutscenes.

Touch the left / right half of the screen to move. Or A and D on a keyboard. 
Complete the goals on each mission to move on to the next one.<br><br>
