When travelling around Per√∫ with friends we fantazised of making a game inspired by all we where seeing and people we where meeting.<br>
A year later I was asked to make a small RPG like project which should make use of particle effects and FMOD studio.

As a result The forest is a moody nano story about a boy and his beloved friend pet in under the heavy rain.

Footsteps are synced through Unity's animation events and the sound variation is defined within the FMOD project.<br>
I found having your sound project independent from the main Unity project greatly improves your workflow.<br>

For color gadient it utilizes Unity's post processing stack.

3d models are third party assets from the Unity Asset store.<br>
Sounds from freesound.org.

You can play it <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/webgl/theForest/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
