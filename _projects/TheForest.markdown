When travelling around Perú with friends we fantazised of making a game inspired by all we where seeing and people we where meeting. Then a year later I was asked to make a small RPG like project which should make use of particle effects and FMOD studio.
So I took some of those ideas to the project and this is what came out of it.

<i>The forest</i> is a moody nano story about a boy and his beloved friend pet under the heavy rain.

Footsteps are synced through Unity's animation events and the sound variation is defined within the FMOD project.<br>
I found having your sound project independent from the main Unity project greatly improves your workflow.<br>

For color gadient it utilizes Unity's post processing stack.

3d models are third party assets from the Unity Asset store.<br>
Sounds from freesound.org.
