Short RPG like game inspired on a trip to Per√∫. It makes use of particle effects and FMOD studio.

<i>The forest is a moody nano story about a boy and his beloved friend pet under the heavy rain.</i>

Footsteps are synced through Unity's animation events and the sound variation is defined within the FMOD project.<br>
I found having your sound project independent from the main Unity project greatly improves your workflow.<br>

For color gadient it utilizes Unity's post processing stack.

3d models are third party assets from the Unity Asset store.<br>
Sounds from freesound.org.
