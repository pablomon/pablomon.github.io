The story describes an alternate present in which most people has lost interest in
human relations.
People now spend most of their time on their own and they are provided and kept
undisturbed by an artificial intelligence whose purpose is to maximize the amount of
time people spend online. While it mainly offers online services, it also takes care of
other aspects of life like transportation, security, elections, etc. There is no real need to go out for food, clothes or electronics, so one can spend weeks inside without unwelcome interactions. 
However not everyone agrees with this lifestyle and a small movement will get set in motion. 
Everything is calm until one day Kiddo receives a package that will make him get involved and question himself and the life he is leading.
