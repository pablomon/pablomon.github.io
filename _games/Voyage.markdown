Fast paced asteroids game. Easy to play but totally unforgiving.

100% spagetti code that makes adding content a great endevour.
It got me acquainted with the app stores.

<br/>
Touch the left half of the screen to move left, the right half moves it right. Try to complete the goals on each mission to move on to the next one.

Features:
- Randomly generated levels.
- Goals system
- Logaritmic difficulty
- End of episodes cutscenes
- Music by <a href="https://s31tech.org" target="_blank"> Section31 </a>
